# makeMutable

`makeMutable` is a function internally used by the [useSharedValue](/docs/core/useSharedValue) hook to create a [shared value](/docs/fundamentals/glossary#shared-value).

It makes it possible to create shared values without the use of the hook, which can be useful in some cases (e.g. in the global scope, as an array of shared values, etc.).

The created object is, in fact, the same as the one returned by `useSharedValue` hook, so the further usage is the same.


## Reference

```javascript
import { makeMutable } from 'react-native-reanimated';

const mv = makeMutable(100);
```

<details>
<summary>Type definitions</summary>

```typescript
interface SharedValue<Value = unknown> {
  value: Value;
  addListener: (listenerID: number, listener: (value: Value) => void) => void;
  removeListener: (listenerID: number) => void;
  modify: (
    modifier?: <T extends Value>(value: T) => T,
    forceUpdate?: boolean
  ) => void;
}

function makeMutable<Value>(initial: Value): SharedValue<Value>;
```

</details>

### Arguments

#### `initial`

The value you want to be initially stored to a `.value` property. It can be any JavaScript value like `number`, `string` or `boolean` but also data structures such as `array` and `object`.

#### Returns

`makeMutable` returns a shared value with a single `value` property initially set to the `initial`.

Values stored in shared values can be accessed and modified by their `.value` property.

## Remarks

- All remarks from the [useSharedValue](/docs/core/useSharedValue) hook apply to `makeMutable` as well.

- Don't use `makeMutable` directly in the component scope. When component re-renders, it will create the completely new object (with the new `initial` value if it was changed) and the state of the previous shared value will be lost.

<Indent>

```javascript
function App() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const mv = makeMutable(counter); // creates a new shared value on each render

  useEffect(() => {
    const interval = setInterval(() => {
      setCounter((prev) => prev + 1); // updates the counter stored in the component state
    }, 1000);

    return () => {
      clearInterval(interval);
    };
  }, [mv]);
  
  useAnimatedReaction(
    () => mv.value,
    (value) => {
      console.log(value); // prints 0, 1, 2, ...
    },
  )
}
```

</Indent>

- Use `cancelAnimation` to stop all animations running on the shared value if it's no longer needed and there are still some animations running. Be super careful with infinite animations, as they will never stop unless you cancel them manually.

<Indent>

```javascript
function App() {
  const mv = useMemo(() => makeMutable(0), []);

  useEffect(() => {
    mv.value = withRepeat(withSpring(100), -1, true); // this creates an infinite animation

    return () => {
      cancelAnimation(mv); // this will stop the infinite animation when the component is unmounted
    };
  }, []);
}
```

</Indent>

- You don't have to use `cancelAnimation` when the value is not animated. It will be garbage collected automatically when no more references to it exist.

<Indent>

```javascript
const someFlag = makeMutable(false);

function App() {
  someFlag.value = true; // no need to cancel the animation
}
```

</Indent>


### Comparison with `useSharedValue`

| `makeMutable` | `useSharedValue` |
| ------------- | ---------------- |
| Creates a new shared value object on each call | Reuses the same shared value object on each call |
| If `initial` value changes, a new shared value object with the new value is created | If `initialValue` value changes, the initially created shared value object is returned without any changes |
| Can be used outside of the component scope | Can be used only inside the component scope |
| Can be used in loops (also when the number of iterations is not constant) | Can be used in loops only if the number of rendered hooks (`useSharedValue` calls) is constant |
| Doesn't automatically cancel animations when the component is unmounted | Automatically cancels animations when the component is unmounted |
